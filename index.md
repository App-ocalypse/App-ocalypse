#### What if I say...
   All apps here'd survive the [app-ocalypse](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apples-idea-of-an-apocalypse-is-a-world-without-apps/)?
   
  But it's **true!**.
  
  All apps that u get here will survive long!
  
  Suppose everything in the world is destroyed.. and humans face an appocalypse! Github pages and repoisitories survive in the Arctic seed vault, but not active, even after thosands of years, if ever the seed valt is opened and reactivated on the web! these apps will 
 run!
